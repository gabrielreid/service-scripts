# Service and example scripts

In this repo you will find scripts that demonstrate general interactions with the Waylay platform. These can be used to accomplish the actions they try to demonstrate, but will not work in every use case. Please use them as a starting point for the specific use case you try to solve. If something is unclear or you would like to get some help implementing something specific, please refer to our [official documentation](https://docs.waylay.io/) or contact us.
